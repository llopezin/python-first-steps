## 🧪 EXERCISE: Build a `Library` System

### 🔧 Goal:
Create a `Library` class that tracks books. Use:

- `@staticmethod` for simple utility
- `@classmethod` for alternative constructor
- **Class state** to store shared data (like a total number of books)
- `self` for instance-specific data

---

### ✍️ Requirements:

#### ✅ Instance attributes:
- `title`
- `author`
- `pages`

#### ✅ Class state:
- A class variable `total_books` that tracks how many books have been created.

#### ✅ Constructor (`__init__`):
- Sets the instance attributes
- Increments `total_books`

#### ✅ Alternative constructor:
- A class method `from_string(cls, book_string)` that takes a string like:
  
  `"The Hobbit;J.R.R. Tolkien;310"`

  and returns a new `Library` instance.

#### ✅ Static method:
- A method `is_lengthy(pages)` that returns `True` if a book has more than **300 pages**.

#### ✅ Print info:
- A method `info(self)` that prints the book details.

---

### 💡 Bonus (optional):
Add a class method `get_total_books(cls)` that returns the value of `total_books`.
